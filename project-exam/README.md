# Structure

Component folders are marked with what they are related to. Such as "Comments", holds everything around user reactions to posts (example: Commenting, reacting to posts).

We use React-query for our requests (useMutate) and cache that data with useQuery. This makes updating and rerendering neat and tidy.

Storing values in localStorage for authentication.

# Components and pages

Components have the first letter as a capital letter (MyComponent.jsx).

Components use modules for css (example: MyComponent.module.css)

Most of the website is navigated in tabs, react-router is used between login and content-page. Also for single posts and single profiles (except users own profile).

# Styles

Mainly using Bootstrap-react default styles with slight modifications.

# Constants

Constants folder for API.

# Layout

Layout folder for layout on the page such as Tabs and Header.

# Tasks are mapped in Trello

# First install

To install the dependancies and get all the library versions.

### `npm install `

# React

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
